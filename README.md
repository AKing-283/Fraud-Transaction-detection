# Fraud-Transaction-detection

This project aims to develop a system for identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time.

**Project Goal**
The goal is to build a model that can effectively distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, minimizing false positives (incorrectly flagged transactions) and false negatives (missed fraudulent transactions).

**Functionality**
This project will involve:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Acquire a dataset of historical transactions, likely containing information like amount, location, time, and user details (anonymized like V1,V2,.....,V28) .
Preprocess the data to clean and prepare it for model training. This may involve handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and feature engineering.
Model Development:

Trained a machine learning model on the preprocessed data. Popular choices for fraud detection include anomaly detection algorithms and neural networks.
Fine-tune the model to achieve optimal performance on the validation set.
Fraud Detection:

Implement the trained model to analyze new transactions in real-time.
Flag transactions with a high probability of being fraudulent for further investigation.
Deliverables
A documented machine learning model for fraud detection.
Code for data preprocessing, model training, and real-time transaction scoring.
A clear evaluation strategy outlining how the model's performance will be measured (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

**Getting Started**
This project assumes a basic understanding of machine learning and Python programming.
